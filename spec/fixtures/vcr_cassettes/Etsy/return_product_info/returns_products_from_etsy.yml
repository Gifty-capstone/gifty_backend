        Mods And IPS Backlit LCD GBA Mod Nintendo GameBoy Advance Watermelon Red","description":"Check
        out the video of overview of all the mods to see how they work and our gallery
        of products here:\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17909877412934131\/\n\nDESCRIPTION
        \n\n1. IPS LCD v2\n   + &quot;4 pixels in 1&quot; compare to AGS101 LCD, it
        means it displays 4 times sharper than AGS101 LCD\n   + Bigger than AGS101
        LCD but still have proportional image\n   + 10 brightness levels (press on
        select + L or R button to change the brightness)\n   + Wider viewing angle\n   +
        Around 10+ hours playing with 1900mah AA battery (brightness level 5, no sound
        upgrade)\n   You will get the newest version of the LCD, no issues.\n\n2.
        Extra mods and shipping (Combine the 2 variations to determine the price,
        choose the &quot;extra mods 1&quot; first) :\n\n  - Louder sound: an amp board
        is installed to amplify the sound. Most of the GBA speakers in the market
        now are very quiet. This mod will improve the sound much better.\n\n\n  -
        OverClocking: Speed up\/down the game. Hardware will be modified so that player
        can change the speed of the game to 3 levels via a switch which is installed
        nicely on the top right of the GBA (see picture). 3 speeds are 0.85x, 1x (normal
        speed) and 1.5x. This mod is for bypassing the long text (games like Pokemon)
        or slowing down the action moving on the fighting games.\n  Note: 0.85x and
        1.5x are for genuine game cartridges only. Do not work stably with flashcart
        at 0.85x and 1.5x (game may freeze). Still functioning with GBA Link Cable
        when both devices are at the same speed (if the second device has this mod
        too).\nSee video at my Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9qgHGFH_Eq\/?igshid=ots3ksxukg3j\n\n  -
        Rechargeable AAs mod: The device is modified so that player can charge the
        rechargeable AAs batteries (Nimh batteries) directly from the device via micro
        usb\/Type C charging port built-in (at the top left of the GBA), please let
        me know in &quot; Personalization box&quot; which kind of port you would like
        (Micro usb or Type C port). Can use any phone charge which has 5v out to charge
        it. (Note that if you choose type C port, it is not compatible with &quot;type
        C to type C&quot; cable, you please use &quot;type A to Type C&quot; cable).\nIt
        still works with normal AAs batteries normally.\n\nLED indicator:\nHigh power:
        green\nLow power: red\nCharged: yellow, when full charged it is off.\n\nOnly
        charge when the batteries are inserted.\n\n  - Bluetooth mod: this mod lets
        you be able to get Bluetooth Audio working on your GBA in case you&#39;d like
        to have your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker work with your favorite handheld.
        This is how it works:\n      \n     + Slide the switch located at the bottom
        of the GBA to turn on the bluetooth function whenever you want to use your
        bluetooth headphones\/speaker, the power led will blink fast in blue and it
        starts searching your bluetooth headphones\/speaker, after successfully pairing
        with your headphone, power led will blink slowly in blue (while the green\/red
        power led of the GBA still works normally)\n     + Turning on the Bluetooth
        function will disable the speaker and headphone jack of the GBA, all the sound
        of the game will be transferred to your bluetooth headphones\/speaker. There
        is a small latency when transferring the sound to the Bluetooth device but
        it is barely noticeable.\n     + You can use either GBA&#39;s volume wheel
        or your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker to adjust the volume of the sound.\n     +
        Connection is good if you keep the the distance between your GBA and your
        Bluetooth Headphones\/Speaker less than 5 meters.\n     + Make sure your bluetooth
        device disconnected before making new connection with the GBA. Sometimes you
        may need to turn on and off the bluetooth to pair succesfully.\n     + Battery
        life of the GBA when using Bluetooth function: around 7-8 hours with 3000
        mAh AAs batteries (Brightness at level 5, IPS LCD).\n     + Due to the power
        supply from just a couple of AA batteries, you will hear noticeable humming
        sound from your bluetooth device when the GBA in standby mode, the humming
        sound will be almost covered by the music of the game (don&#39;t worry there
        is not any background sound from the inner speaker and the headphone jack
        of the GBA).\n     + It is compatible with most of bluetooth devices in the
        market now, but I can not test every bluetooth device to say surely it will
        work with your bluetooth device, if you find out it can not pair with your
        bluetooth device after receiving the GBA, please try with another bluetooth
        device.\n\n\n  - Fast shipping: arrive in 10-15 days after shipment. Tracking
        information will be only available after the package arrives customer&#39;s
        country (around 7-10 days after shipment).\n        + The item is shipped
        from Asia. Default shipping is standard method. It takes 15-30 days to arrive,
        depends on local customs processing and which country customer is living.\n        +
        Super fast shipping: arrive in 3 - 5 days. Contact me if you want super fast
        shipping method.\n\n3. Other details of the product:\n\n+ Glass lens with
        no scratches and very pure.\n\n+ High quality conductive silicone were installed.
        The Dpad, AB buttons feel great and responsive (Most of normal conductive
        silicone in the market now make the Dpad,AB buttons really stiff).\n\n+ Shell
        is modified correctly which makes the shell close properly, two parts of the
        shell fit well.\n\n***These upgrades need more power so we should use rechargeable
        AAs battery for better playtime. And the battery life depends on its brandname.\n\n4.
        Tiny dust may fly to the backside of the lens while being shipped. This is
        out of my control.\n\n5. No battery, no cartridge, no charger (if you choose
        rechargeable mod) include.\n \n\nOthers:  \n\n1. We are sorry that we won&#39;t
        be responsible for any wrong or undeliverable addresses \n\n2. Order will
        be shipped out within 2-3 business days after receiving cleared payment \n\nInternational

        of Zelda themed scented soy candle - plus other fandoms.","description":"It&#39;s
        dangerous to go alone!  Smell this.  Curious what the Lost Woods smells like?  Or
        the (pre-calamity) courtyard of Hyrule Castle?  Or maybe a pastry or milkshake
        from Lon Lon ranch?  Now you can find out. \n\nDon&#39;t worry, you can order
        any of my candles in this listing.  Each scent is carefully paired with the
        theme to evoke the feel, location or vibe of said fandom.  Lost Woods smells
        like a green forest, Headmaster&#39;s Office smells like lemon drops, Jedi
        Temple smells like a meditation chamber, and Rivendell smells like what a
        clean and fragrant community of elves might smell like.  \n\nThese are 100%
        natural soy candles hand poured geeky goodness.  They are all approximately
        7oz in size and are phthalate free (if that matters to you) and will burn
        cleanly for up to 50 hours.  The fragrance oils used are the same that are
        used for lotions and soaps, so they are skin safe and non-toxic.  \n\nI have
        updated my labels for a more consistent appearance across my entire product
        line.  Starting 2\/8\/21, candles may ship with the new labels OR the old
        ones as current inventory allows.  Either way, they are exactly the same in
        quality and scent but with a fresh new look.\n\n-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  \nWant

        considering just 2, it&#39;s a much better deal to just get a third.  You
        can choose from any candle that I make.\n-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  \n\n  .--.      .-&#39;.      .--.      .--.      .--.      .--.      .`-.      .--.       .--.      .-&#39;.      .--.      .--.      \n:::::.\\::::::::.\\::::::::.\\::::::::.\\::::::::.\\::::::::.\\::::::::.\\::::::::.\\:::::.\\::::::::.\\::::::::.\\::::::::.\n&#39;      `--&#39;      `.-&#39;      `--&#39;      `--&#39;      `--&#39;      `-.&#39;      `--&#39;      `--&#39;      `.-&#39;      `--&#39;      `--&#39;      `--\n\nWhy
        soy? Well...\n\n1) Soy candles are natural since they\u2019re made from vegetable
        oil (soybeans). On the other hand, paraffin candles are made from petroleum
        oil.\n\n2) Soy candles burn around 50% longer.\n\n3) Soy candles don&#39;t
        create the black soot that paraffin candles do.\n\n4) Soy candles are non-toxic.\n\n5)
        The scent (hot throw) from soy candles is much stronger.\n\n  .--.      .-&#39;.      .--.      .--.      .--.      .`-.      .--.       .--.      .-&#39;.      .--.      .--.     \n:::::.\\::::::::.\\::::::::.\\  WHAT

        to see how they work and our gallery of products here:\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17909877412934131\/\n\nDESCRIPTION
        \n\n1. IPS LCD v2\n   + &quot;4 pixels in 1&quot; compare to AGS101 LCD, it
        means it displays 4 times sharper than AGS101 LCD\n   + Bigger than AGS101
        LCD but still have proportional image\n   + 10 brightness levels (press on
        select + L or R button to change the brightness)\n   + Wider viewing angle\n   +
        Around 10+ hours playing with 1900mah AA battery (brightness level 5, no sound
        upgrade)\n   You will get the newest version of the LCD, no issues.\n\n2.
        Extra mods and shipping (Combine the 2 variations to determine the price,
        choose the &quot;extra mods 1&quot; first) :\n\n  - Louder sound: an amp board
        is installed to amplify the sound. Most of the GBA speakers in the market
        now are very quiet. This mod will improve the sound much better.\n\n\n  -
        OverClocking: Speed up\/down the game. Hardware will be modified so that player
        can change the speed of the game to 3 levels via a switch which is installed
        nicely on the top right of the GBA (see picture). 3 speeds are 0.85x, 1x (normal
        speed) and 1.5x. This mod is for bypassing the long text (games like Pokemon)
        or slowing down the action moving on the fighting games.\n  Note: 0.85x and
        1.5x are for genuine game cartridges only. Do not work stably with flashcart
        at 0.85x and 1.5x (game may freeze). Still functioning with GBA Link Cable
        when both devices are at the same speed (if the second device has this mod
        too).\nSee video at my Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9qgHGFH_Eq\/?igshid=ots3ksxukg3j\n\n  -
        Rechargeable AAs mod: The device is modified so that player can charge the
        rechargeable AAs batteries (Nimh batteries) directly from the device via micro
        usb\/Type C charging port built-in (at the top left of the GBA), please let
        me know in &quot; Personalization box&quot; which kind of port you would like
        (Micro usb or Type C port). Can use any phone charge which has 5v out to charge
        it. (Note that if you choose type C port, it is not compatible with &quot;type
        C to type C&quot; cable, you please use &quot;type A to Type C&quot; cable).\nIt
        still works with normal AAs batteries normally.\n\nLED indicator:\nHigh power:
        green\nLow power: red\nCharged: yellow, when full charged it is off.\n\nOnly
        charge when the batteries are inserted.\n\n  - Bluetooth mod: this mod lets
        you be able to get Bluetooth Audio working on your GBA in case you&#39;d like
        to have your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker work with your favorite handheld.
        This is how it works:\n      \n     + Slide the switch located at the bottom
        of the GBA to turn on the bluetooth function whenever you want to use your
        bluetooth headphones\/speaker, the power led will blink fast in blue and it
        starts searching your bluetooth headphones\/speaker, after successfully pairing
        with your headphone, power led will blink slowly in blue (while the green\/red
        power led of the GBA still works normally)\n     + Turning on the Bluetooth
        function will disable the speaker and headphone jack of the GBA, all the sound
        of the game will be transferred to your bluetooth headphones\/speaker. There
        is a small latency when transferring the sound to the Bluetooth device but
        it is barely noticeable.\n     + You can use either GBA&#39;s volume wheel
        or your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker to adjust the volume of the sound.\n     +
        Connection is good if you keep the the distance between your GBA and your
        Bluetooth Headphones\/Speaker less than 5 meters.\n     + Make sure your bluetooth
        device disconnected before making new connection with the GBA. Sometimes you
        may need to turn on and off the bluetooth to pair succesfully.\n     + Battery
        life of the GBA when using Bluetooth function: around 7-8 hours with 3000
        mAh AAs batteries (Brightness at level 5, IPS LCD).\n     + Due to the power
        supply from just a couple of AA batteries, you will hear noticeable humming
        sound from your bluetooth device when the GBA in standby mode, the humming
        sound will be almost covered by the music of the game (don&#39;t worry there
        is not any background sound from the inner speaker and the headphone jack
        of the GBA).\n     + It is compatible with most of bluetooth devices in the
        market now, but I can not test every bluetooth device to say surely it will
        work with your bluetooth device, if you find out it can not pair with your
        bluetooth device after receiving the GBA, please try with another bluetooth
        device.\n\n\n  - Fast shipping: arrive in 10-15 days after shipment. Tracking
        information will be only available after the package arrives customer&#39;s
        country (around 7-10 days after shipment).\n        + The item is shipped
        from Asia. Default shipping is standard method. It takes 15-30 days to arrive,
        depends on local customs processing and which country customer is living.\n        +
        Super fast shipping: arrive in 3 - 5 days. Contact me if you want super fast
        shipping method.\n\n3. Other details of the product:\n\n+ Glass lens with
        no scratches and very pure.\n\n+ High quality conductive silicone were installed.
        The Dpad, AB buttons feel great and responsive (Most of normal conductive
        silicone in the market now make the Dpad,AB buttons really stiff).\n\n+ Shell
        is modified correctly which makes the shell close properly, two parts of the
        shell fit well.\n\n***These upgrades need more power so we should use rechargeable
        AAs battery for better playtime. And the battery life depends on its brandname.\n\n4.
        Tiny dust may fly to the backside of the lens while being shipped. This is
        out of my control.\n\n5. No battery, no cartridge, no charger (if you choose
        rechargeable mod) include.\n \n\nOthers:  \n\n1. We are sorry that we won&#39;t
        be responsible for any wrong or undeliverable addresses \n\n2. Order will
        be shipped out within 2-3 business days after receiving cleared payment \n\nInternational

        Mods And IPS Backlit LCD GBA Mod Nintendo GameBoy Advance Fire Emblem Awakening
        Edition","description":"Check out the video of overview of all the mods to
        see how they work and our gallery of products here:\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17909877412934131\/\n\nDESCRIPTION
        \n\n1. IPS LCD v2\n   + &quot;4 pixels in 1&quot; compare to AGS101 LCD, it
        means it displays 4 times sharper than AGS101 LCD\n   + Bigger than AGS101
        LCD but still have proportional image\n   + 10 brightness levels (press on
        select + L or R button to change the brightness)\n   + Wider viewing angle\n   +
        Around 10+ hours playing with 1900mah AA battery (brightness level 5, no sound
        upgrade)\n   You will get the newest version of the LCD, no issues.\n\n2.
        Extra mods and shipping (Combine the 2 variations to determine the price,
        choose the &quot;extra mods 1&quot; first) :\n\n  - Louder sound: an amp board
        is installed to amplify the sound. Most of the GBA speakers in the market
        now are very quiet. This mod will improve the sound much better.\n\n\n  -
        OverClocking: Speed up\/down the game. Hardware will be modified so that player
        can change the speed of the game to 3 levels via a switch which is installed
        nicely on the top right of the GBA (see picture). 3 speeds are 0.85x, 1x (normal
        speed) and 1.5x. This mod is for bypassing the long text (games like Pokemon)
        or slowing down the action moving on the fighting games.\n  Note: 0.85x and
        1.5x are for genuine game cartridges only. Do not work stably with flashcart
        at 0.85x and 1.5x (game may freeze). Still functioning with GBA Link Cable
        when both devices are at the same speed (if the second device has this mod
        too).\nSee video at my Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9qgHGFH_Eq\/?igshid=ots3ksxukg3j\n\n  -
        Rechargeable AAs mod: The device is modified so that player can charge the
        rechargeable AAs batteries (Nimh batteries) directly from the device via micro
        usb\/Type C charging port built-in (at the top left of the GBA), please let
        me know in &quot; Personalization box&quot; which kind of port you would like
        (Micro usb or Type C port). Can use any phone charge which has 5v out to charge
        it. (Note that if you choose type C port, it is not compatible with &quot;type
        C to type C&quot; cable, you please use &quot;type A to Type C&quot; cable).\nIt
        still works with normal AAs batteries normally.\n\nLED indicator:\nHigh power:
        green\nLow power: red\nCharged: yellow, when full charged it is off.\n\nOnly
        charge when the batteries are inserted.\n\n  - Bluetooth mod: this mod lets
        you be able to get Bluetooth Audio working on your GBA in case you&#39;d like
        to have your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker work with your favorite handheld.
        This is how it works:\n      \n     + Slide the switch located at the bottom
        of the GBA to turn on the bluetooth function whenever you want to use your
        bluetooth headphones\/speaker, the power led will blink fast in blue and it
        starts searching your bluetooth headphones\/speaker, after successfully pairing
        with your headphone, power led will blink slowly in blue (while the green\/red
        power led of the GBA still works normally)\n     + Turning on the Bluetooth
        function will disable the speaker and headphone jack of the GBA, all the sound
        of the game will be transferred to your bluetooth headphones\/speaker. There
        is a small latency when transferring the sound to the Bluetooth device but
        it is barely noticeable.\n     + You can use either GBA&#39;s volume wheel
        or your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker to adjust the volume of the sound.\n     +
        Connection is good if you keep the the distance between your GBA and your
        Bluetooth Headphones\/Speaker less than 5 meters.\n     + Make sure your bluetooth
        device disconnected before making new connection with the GBA. Sometimes you
        may need to turn on and off the bluetooth to pair succesfully.\n     + Battery
        life of the GBA when using Bluetooth function: around 7-8 hours with 3000
        mAh AAs batteries (Brightness at level 5, IPS LCD).\n     + Due to the power
        supply from just a couple of AA batteries, you will hear noticeable humming
        sound from your bluetooth device when the GBA in standby mode, the humming
        sound will be almost covered by the music of the game (don&#39;t worry there
        is not any background sound from the inner speaker and the headphone jack
        of the GBA).\n     + It is compatible with most of bluetooth devices in the
        market now, but I can not test every bluetooth device to say surely it will
        work with your bluetooth device, if you find out it can not pair with your
        bluetooth device after receiving the GBA, please try with another bluetooth
        device.\n\n\n  - Fast shipping: arrive in 10-15 days after shipment. Tracking
        information will be only available after the package arrives customer&#39;s
        country (around 7-10 days after shipment).\n        + The item is shipped
        from Asia. Default shipping is standard method. It takes 15-30 days to arrive,
        depends on local customs processing and which country customer is living.\n        +
        Super fast shipping: arrive in 3 - 5 days. Contact me if you want super fast
        shipping method.\n\n3. Other details of the product:\n\n+ Glass lens with
        no scratches and very pure.\n\n+ High quality conductive silicone were installed.
        The Dpad, AB buttons feel great and responsive (Most of normal conductive
        silicone in the market now make the Dpad,AB buttons really stiff).\n\n+ Shell
        is modified correctly which makes the shell close properly, two parts of the
        shell fit well.\n\n***These upgrades need more power so we should use rechargeable
        AAs battery for better playtime. And the battery life depends on its brandname.\n\n4.
        Tiny dust may fly to the backside of the lens while being shipped. This is
        out of my control.\n\n5. No battery, no cartridge, no charger (if you choose
        rechargeable mod) include.\n \n\nOthers:  \n\n1. We are sorry that we won&#39;t
        be responsible for any wrong or undeliverable addresses \n\n2. Order will
        be shipped out within 2-3 business days after receiving cleared payment \n\nInternational

        Space gray or black aluminum RG351M, pre-configured handheld console, 128GB
        Batocera, Emuelec or ArkOS 40+ systems+heatsink mod","description":"AsRg351M
        Anbernic, Batocera, 351elec or Arkos OS 128GB Micro SD card, Handheld Game
        Console. Condition is New\nCopper heatsink installation has been applied to
        the unit for cooler operations. Some of the benefits of heatsinking are to
        keep the system cooler for prolonged periods of gaming, prevent heat throttling
        and allow maximum performance, preserving battery life as well by preventing
        heat throttling and prolonging the life of the unit by preventing burnout
        or heat damage.\nThere are three options for emulation with the system as
        I&#39;ve mentioned in the title, they all are different and range from anywhere
        from 9000 titles to 10,000 depending on which system you choose. Select the
        system of choice on checkout.\n\nThe pictures included do this system no justice
        as the camera does not capture the crisp LCD detail, the user interface has
        a high definition resolution.\nThis RG351M comes with all original packaging,
        the system can be configured with batocera, 351elec or Arkos with a high speed
        SanDisk 128GB micro SD card which has been pre-configured and ready to play
        with over 9000 titles.\n\nBatocera runs excellent and can handle the majority
        of titles without any freezing or frame drops, however there are a small fraction
        of titles there are international language but they can be replaced with English
        ROMs if you wish to.\nThe latest 351 elec is one of the best operating systems
        for this handheld as it supports and plays many titles very well, it also
        includes the ability to download many themes and other game packs as well
        as configurations, this particular version of the software supports the built-in
        Wi-Fi of the 351M and includes almost 10,000 titles. \n\nIf you want Wireless
        connection then a cheap USB dongle would suffice as the internal wireless
        is not compatible with the current Batocera but it does not affect the gameplay
        at all, the only reason to use wireless is for possible multiplayer net play
        or possible transfer of titles from the computer which can also be achieved
        by using usb-c connection. There&#39;s also a discrepancy with the battery
        percentage being displayed inaccurately due to a script written for a larger
        MAH capacity battery, this is not a major concern and is not hardware-related
        but it&#39;s simply a software issue which resolves after regular use.\n\n\nDisclaimer:

        of all things Nintendo with this art print set. You&#39;ll receive all 8 (that&#39;s
        right, ALL OF THEM!) digital art prints in multiple sizes.\n\nThe colors of
        these prints are not random - these are the exact colors (based on HEX coding)
        that you will find on these consoles. Featured are controllers inspired by
        the Nintendo Wii, Wii U, NES, Super Nintendo, Gamecube, Switch, N64 as well
        as the Gameboy. Perfect decor for a game room, office, or kids bedroom. When
        framed, these prints are the perfect gift for the video game or Nintendo fan
        in your life.\n\n\u2022\u2022WHY CHOOSE DIGITAL DOWNLOADS?\u2022\u2022\nDecorating
        your home with artwork is an instant way to brighten up your space and show
        your character, but it can be very expensive. With a digital download, you
        are able to print out the exact size you need for your space and use your
        existing (or thrifted!) frames. Print your new artwork at home, OR, go to
        a local print & copy place either online or in person. I personally am a big
        fan of using Walgreens.com, which always has amazing coupon codes for extra
        savings (50% off is very common).\n\n\u2022\u2022 WHAT YOU&#39;LL RECEIVE
        \u2022\u2022\nAfter your purchase, you will immediately receive a high-quality
        digital file of your new artwork from Etsy. Your file will include 32 JPEG
        images as well as a sizing guide to help you choose the right file for your
        frame. Print as a poster or in standard frame sizes. Please note that no physical
        copy will be sent.\n\n\u2022\u2022INCLUDED FILES\u2022\u2022\nIncluded are
        32 high resolution JPG image files for printing the following sizes:\n3:2
        ratio file for printing 8&quot;x12&quot;, 12&quot;x18&quot;, 16&quot;x24&quot;\n4:3
