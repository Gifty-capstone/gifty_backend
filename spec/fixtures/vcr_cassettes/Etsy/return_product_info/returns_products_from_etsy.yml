        and go to the checkout. When purchasing these 2, simply leave the full name
        of the 3rd FREE print (of the same size or smaller) you would like in the

        note with your order and make sure to include the free print with your purchase:)
        \n\n\u2665 SIZES \u2665\nWe offer several sizes to suit your needs starting
        from 2.5 X 3.5 (Wallet Size). Available sizes are shown in the SELECT A SIZE
        drop down menu above the ADD TO CART button. All the sizes offered are standard
        sizes and frames can easily be found online and at any frame or craft store
        once you are ready to hang your prints. The A3 (11.7 X 16.5) and A4 (8.3 X
        11.7) are standard European sizes.\n\n\u2665 PRINTING \u2665\nAll of our prints
        are created by a process called Gicl\u00e9e (a French word for &quot;spray&#39;).
        The inks used in this process have a much higher resistance to fading than
        normal printing inks, which makes this kind of printing particularly suitable
        for prints being used in wall decor. I use the best quality printing paper
        - Epson Premium Lustre Paper and inks - Archival Pigment inks. The specially
        coated surface of this paper enhances the colour depth and vibrancy of each
        print. It also comes with a guarantee of lifetime fade resistance. \nPLEASE
        NOTE: This listing is for the print only, does not include the frame\n\n\u2665
        SHIPPING \u2665\n2.5 X 3.5, 4 x 6, 5 x 7, 8 x 10 and A4 prints will be shipped
        flat in a protective, archival sleeve inside a cardboard envelope. Larger
        prints will be shipped in a sturdy cardboard mailing tube. All prints will
        reach you in pristine condition.\n\n\u2665 TURNAROUND TIME \u2665\nYour print
        will be made with care, packaged securely and shipped within 1-2 business
        days of purchase in a sturdy cardboard mailing tube via An Post Parcel Services,
        Ireland. It will then be delivered by the national postal service of the destination

        how they work and our gallery of products here:\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17909877412934131\/\n\nDESCRIPTION
        \n\n1. IPS LCD v2\n   + &quot;4 pixels in 1&quot; compare to AGS101 LCD, it
        means it displays 4 times sharper than AGS101 LCD\n   + Bigger than AGS101
        LCD but still have proportional image\n   + 10 brightness levels (press on
        select + L or R button to change the brightness)\n   + Wider viewing angle\n   +
        Around 10+ hours playing with 1900mah AA battery (brightness level 5, no sound
        upgrade)\n   You will get the newest version of the LCD, no issues.\n\n2.
        Extra mods and shipping (Combine the 2 variations to determine the price,
        choose the &quot;extra mods 1&quot; first) :\n\n  - Louder sound: an amp board
        is installed to amplify the sound. Most of the GBA speakers in the market
        now are very quiet. This mod will improve the sound much better.\n\n\n  -
        OverClocking: Speed up\/down the game. Hardware will be modified so that player
        can change the speed of the game to 3 levels via a switch which is installed
        nicely on the top right of the GBA (see picture). 3 speeds are 0.85x, 1x (normal
        speed) and 1.5x. This mod is for bypassing the long text (games like Pokemon)
        or slowing down the action moving on the fighting games.\n  Note: 0.85x and
        1.5x are for genuine game cartridges only. Do not work stably with flashcart
        at 0.85x and 1.5x (game may freeze). Still functioning with GBA Link Cable
        when both devices are at the same speed (if the second device has this mod
        too).\nSee video at my Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9qgHGFH_Eq\/?igshid=ots3ksxukg3j\n\n  -
        Rechargeable AAs mod: The device is modified so that player can charge the
        rechargeable AAs batteries (Nimh batteries) directly from the device via micro
        usb\/Type C charging port built-in (at the top left of the GBA), please let
        me know in &quot; Personalization box&quot; which kind of port you would like
        (Micro usb or Type C port). Can use any phone charge which has 5v out to charge
        it. (Note that if you choose type C port, it is not compatible with &quot;type
        C to type C&quot; cable, you please use &quot;type A to Type C&quot; cable).\nIt
        still works with normal AAs batteries normally.\n\nLED indicator:\nHigh power:
        green\nLow power: red\nCharged: yellow, when full charged it is off.\n\nOnly
        charge when the batteries are inserted.\n\n  - Bluetooth mod: this mod lets
        you be able to get Bluetooth Audio working on your GBA in case you&#39;d like
        to have your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker work with your favorite handheld.
        This is how it works:\n      \n     + Slide the switch located at the bottom
        of the GBA to turn on the bluetooth function whenever you want to use your
        bluetooth headphones\/speaker, the power led will blink fast in blue and it
        starts searching your bluetooth headphones\/speaker, after successfully pairing
        with your headphone, power led will blink slowly in blue (while the green\/red
        power led of the GBA still works normally)\n     + Turning on the Bluetooth
        function will disable the speaker and headphone jack of the GBA, all the sound
        of the game will be transferred to your bluetooth headphones\/speaker. There
        is a small latency when transferring the sound to the Bluetooth device but
        it is barely noticeable.\n     + You can use either GBA&#39;s volume wheel
        or your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker to adjust the volume of the sound.\n     +
        Connection is good if you keep the the distance between your GBA and your
        Bluetooth Headphones\/Speaker less than 5 meters.\n     + Make sure your bluetooth
        device disconnected before making new connection with the GBA. Sometimes you
        may need to turn on and off the bluetooth to pair succesfully.\n     + Battery
        life of the GBA when using Bluetooth function: around 7-8 hours with 3000
        mAh AAs batteries (Brightness at level 5, IPS LCD).\n     + Due to the power
        supply from just a couple of AA batteries, you will hear noticeable humming
        sound from your bluetooth device when the GBA in standby mode, the humming
        sound will be almost covered by the music of the game (don&#39;t worry there
        is not any background sound from the inner speaker and the headphone jack
        of the GBA).\n     + It is compatible with most of bluetooth devices in the
        market now, but I can not test every bluetooth device to say surely it will
        work with your bluetooth device, if you find out it can not pair with your
        bluetooth device after receiving the GBA, please try with another bluetooth
        device.\n\n\n  - Fast shipping: arrive in 10-15 days after shipment. Tracking
        information will be only available after the package arrives customer&#39;s
        country (around 7-10 days after shipment).\n        + The item is shipped
        from Asia. Default shipping is standard method. It takes 15-30 days to arrive,
        depends on local customs processing and which country customer is living.\n        +
        Super fast shipping: arrive in 3 - 5 days. Contact me if you want super fast
        shipping method.\n\n3. Other details of the product:\n\n+ Glass lens with
        no scratches and very pure.\n\n+ High quality conductive silicone were installed.
        The Dpad, AB buttons feel great and responsive (Most of normal conductive
        silicone in the market now make the Dpad,AB buttons really stiff).\n\n+ Shell
        is modified correctly which makes the shell close properly, two parts of the
        shell fit well.\n\n***These upgrades need more power so we should use rechargeable
        AAs battery for better playtime. And the battery life depends on its brandname.\n\n4.
        Tiny dust may fly to the backside of the lens while being shipped. This is
        out of my control.\n\n5. No battery, no cartridge, no charger (if you choose
        rechargeable mod) include.\n \n\nOthers:  \n\n1. We are sorry that we won&#39;t
        be responsible for any wrong or undeliverable addresses \n\n2. Order will
        be shipped out within 2-3 business days after receiving cleared payment \n\nInternational

        colorful and unique lamp is made of a quarter inch maple plywood frame, colored

        heavy construction paper to add a bit of texture to the bricks on either side.\n\nFeatures:\n-
        This is our largest lamp at 16.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; x 5.5&quot;\n- Long 15&#39;
        cord capable of hanging the lamp, standard base size\n- Two openings for easy
        wall mounting on back of lamp\n\nPerfect for a kid&#39;s room, as well as
        those who still think they are kids (which is very okay, I definitely have
        one of these over my desk). Ships fully assembled with one bulb in the US
        and Canada. For over seas purchases, its worth noting that the lamp has a
        North American outlet plug, so an adapter will be needed if you live in a
        region with different electrical standards.\n\nPlease only use fluorescent
        bulbs with the lamp, as standard incandescent bulbs create much much more
        heat, and can occasionally cause warping if the lamp is left on for an extended
        period of time.\n\nEach lamp will be assembled and shipped within 3 to 5 business

        casting the iconic logo onto any nearby surface \n\nThe lamp measures 8-inches
        wide, and about 3.5 inches deep.  The bottom is almost entirely open, allowing
        easy access to the bulb, and making the lamp perfect for hanging over a table
        or corner chair. Bulb included is included. Top portion has a secret door,

        bottom one. \n\nPiece is built with two 1\/8th inch holes to hang with a small

        \n\n1. IPS LCD v2\n   + &quot;4 pixels in 1&quot; compare to AGS101 LCD, it
        means it displays 4 times sharper than AGS101 LCD\n   + Bigger than AGS101
        LCD but still have proportional image\n   + 10 brightness levels (press on
        select + L or R button to change the brightness)\n   + Wider viewing angle\n   +
        Around 10+ hours playing with 1900mah AA battery (brightness level 5, no sound
        upgrade)\n   You will get the newest version of the LCD, no issues.\n\n2.
        Extra mods and shipping (Combine the 2 variations to determine the price,
        choose the &quot;extra mods 1&quot; first) :\n\n  - Louder sound: an amp board
        is installed to amplify the sound. Most of the GBA speakers in the market
        now are very quiet. This mod will improve the sound much better.\n\n\n  -
        OverClocking: Speed up\/down the game. Hardware will be modified so that player
        can change the speed of the game to 3 levels via a switch which is installed
        nicely on the top right of the GBA (see picture). 3 speeds are 0.85x, 1x (normal
        speed) and 1.5x. This mod is for bypassing the long text (games like Pokemon)
        or slowing down the action moving on the fighting games.\n  Note: 0.85x and
        1.5x are for genuine game cartridges only. Do not work stably with flashcart
        at 0.85x and 1.5x (game may freeze). Still functioning with GBA Link Cable
        when both devices are at the same speed (if the second device has this mod
        too).\nSee video at my Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9qgHGFH_Eq\/?igshid=ots3ksxukg3j\n\n  -
        Rechargeable AAs mod: The device is modified so that player can charge the
        rechargeable AAs batteries (Nimh batteries) directly from the device via micro
        usb\/Type C charging port built-in (at the top left of the GBA), please let
        me know in &quot; Personalization box&quot; which kind of port you would like
        (Micro usb or Type C port). Can use any phone charge which has 5v out to charge
        it. (Note that if you choose type C port, it is not compatible with &quot;type
        C to type C&quot; cable, you please use &quot;type A to Type C&quot; cable).\nIt
        still works with normal AAs batteries normally.\n\nLED indicator:\nHigh power:
        green\nLow power: red\nCharged: yellow, when full charged it is off.\n\nOnly
        charge when the batteries are inserted.\n\n  - Bluetooth mod: this mod lets
        you be able to get Bluetooth Audio working on your GBA in case you&#39;d like
        to have your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker work with your favorite handheld.
        This is how it works:\n      \n     + Slide the switch located at the bottom
        of the GBA to turn on the bluetooth function whenever you want to use your
        bluetooth headphones\/speaker, the power led will blink fast in blue and it
        starts searching your bluetooth headphones\/speaker, after successfully pairing
        with your headphone, power led will blink slowly in blue (while the green\/red
        power led of the GBA still works normally)\n     + Turning on the Bluetooth
        function will disable the speaker and headphone jack of the GBA, all the sound
        of the game will be transferred to your bluetooth headphones\/speaker. There
        is a small latency when transferring the sound to the Bluetooth device but
        it is barely noticeable.\n     + You can use either GBA&#39;s volume wheel
        or your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker to adjust the volume of the sound.\n     +
        Connection is good if you keep the the distance between your GBA and your
        Bluetooth Headphones\/Speaker less than 5 meters.\n     + Make sure your bluetooth
        device disconnected before making new connection with the GBA. Sometimes you
        may need to turn on and off the bluetooth to pair succesfully.\n     + Battery
        life of the GBA when using Bluetooth function: around 7-8 hours with 3000
        mAh AAs batteries (Brightness at level 5, IPS LCD).\n     + Due to the power
        supply from just a couple of AA batteries, you will hear noticeable humming
        sound from your bluetooth device when the GBA in standby mode, the humming
        sound will be almost covered by the music of the game (don&#39;t worry there
        is not any background sound from the inner speaker and the headphone jack
        of the GBA).\n     + It is compatible with most of bluetooth devices in the
        market now, but I can not test every bluetooth device to say surely it will
        work with your bluetooth device, if you find out it can not pair with your
        bluetooth device after receiving the GBA, please try with another bluetooth
        device.\n\n\n  - Fast shipping: arrive in 10-15 days after shipment. Tracking
        information will be only available after the package arrives customer&#39;s
        country (around 7-10 days after shipment).\n        + The item is shipped
        from Asia. Default shipping is standard method. It takes 15-30 days to arrive,
        depends on local customs processing and which country customer is living.\n        +
        Super fast shipping: arrive in 3 - 5 days. Contact me if you want super fast
        shipping method.\n\n3. Other details of the product:\n\n+ Glass lens with
        no scratches and very pure.\n\n+ High quality conductive silicone were installed.
        The Dpad, AB buttons feel great and responsive (Most of normal conductive
        silicone in the market now make the Dpad,AB buttons really stiff).\n\n+ Shell
        is modified correctly which makes the shell close properly, two parts of the
        shell fit well.\n\n***These upgrades need more power so we should use rechargeable
        AAs battery for better playtime. And the battery life depends on its brandname.\n\n4.
        Tiny dust may fly to the backside of the lens while being shipped. This is
        out of my control.\n\n5. No battery, no cartridge, no charger (if you choose
        rechargeable mod) include.\n \n\nOthers:  \n\n1. We are sorry that we won&#39;t
        be responsible for any wrong or undeliverable addresses \n\n2. Order will
        be shipped out within 2-3 business days after receiving cleared payment \n\nInternational

        out the video of overview of all the mods to see how they work and our gallery
        of products here:\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17909877412934131\/\n\nDESCRIPTION
        \n\n1. IPS LCD v2\n   + &quot;4 pixels in 1&quot; compare to AGS101 LCD, it
        means it displays 4 times sharper than AGS101 LCD\n   + Bigger than AGS101
        LCD but still have proportional image\n   + 10 brightness levels (press on
        select + L or R button to change the brightness)\n   + Wider viewing angle\n   +
        Around 10+ hours playing with 1900mah AA battery (brightness level 5, no sound
        upgrade)\n   You will get the newest version of the LCD, no issues.\n\n2.
        Extra mods and shipping (Combine the 2 variations to determine the price,
        choose the &quot;extra mods 1&quot; first) :\n\n  - Louder sound: an amp board
        is installed to amplify the sound. Most of the GBA speakers in the market
        now are very quiet. This mod will improve the sound much better.\n\n\n  -
        OverClocking: Speed up\/down the game. Hardware will be modified so that player
        can change the speed of the game to 3 levels via a switch which is installed
        nicely on the top right of the GBA (see picture). 3 speeds are 0.85x, 1x (normal
        speed) and 1.5x. This mod is for bypassing the long text (games like Pokemon)
        or slowing down the action moving on the fighting games.\n  Note: 0.85x and
        1.5x are for genuine game cartridges only. Do not work stably with flashcart
        at 0.85x and 1.5x (game may freeze). Still functioning with GBA Link Cable
        when both devices are at the same speed (if the second device has this mod
        too).\nSee video at my Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9qgHGFH_Eq\/?igshid=ots3ksxukg3j\n\n  -
        Rechargeable AAs mod: The device is modified so that player can charge the
        rechargeable AAs batteries (Nimh batteries) directly from the device via micro
        usb\/Type C charging port built-in (at the top left of the GBA), please let
        me know in &quot; Personalization box&quot; which kind of port you would like
        (Micro usb or Type C port). Can use any phone charge which has 5v out to charge
        it. (Note that if you choose type C port, it is not compatible with &quot;type
        C to type C&quot; cable, you please use &quot;type A to Type C&quot; cable).\nIt
        still works with normal AAs batteries normally.\n\nLED indicator:\nHigh power:
        green\nLow power: red\nCharged: yellow, when full charged it is off.\n\nOnly
        charge when the batteries are inserted.\n\n  - Bluetooth mod: this mod lets
        you be able to get Bluetooth Audio working on your GBA in case you&#39;d like
        to have your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker work with your favorite handheld.
        This is how it works:\n      \n     + Slide the switch located at the bottom
        of the GBA to turn on the bluetooth function whenever you want to use your
        bluetooth headphones\/speaker, the power led will blink fast in blue and it
        starts searching your bluetooth headphones\/speaker, after successfully pairing
        with your headphone, power led will blink slowly in blue (while the green\/red
        power led of the GBA still works normally)\n     + Turning on the Bluetooth
        function will disable the speaker and headphone jack of the GBA, all the sound
        of the game will be transferred to your bluetooth headphones\/speaker. There
        is a small latency when transferring the sound to the Bluetooth device but
        it is barely noticeable.\n     + You can use either GBA&#39;s volume wheel
        or your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker to adjust the volume of the sound.\n     +
        Connection is good if you keep the the distance between your GBA and your
        Bluetooth Headphones\/Speaker less than 5 meters.\n     + Make sure your bluetooth
        device disconnected before making new connection with the GBA. Sometimes you
        may need to turn on and off the bluetooth to pair succesfully.\n     + Battery
        life of the GBA when using Bluetooth function: around 7-8 hours with 3000
        mAh AAs batteries (Brightness at level 5, IPS LCD).\n     + Due to the power
        supply from just a couple of AA batteries, you will hear noticeable humming
        sound from your bluetooth device when the GBA in standby mode, the humming
        sound will be almost covered by the music of the game (don&#39;t worry there
        is not any background sound from the inner speaker and the headphone jack
        of the GBA).\n     + It is compatible with most of bluetooth devices in the
        market now, but I can not test every bluetooth device to say surely it will
        work with your bluetooth device, if you find out it can not pair with your
        bluetooth device after receiving the GBA, please try with another bluetooth
        device.\n\n\n  - Fast shipping: arrive in 10-15 days after shipment. Tracking
        information will be only available after the package arrives customer&#39;s
        country (around 7-10 days after shipment).\n        + The item is shipped
        from Asia. Default shipping is standard method. It takes 15-30 days to arrive,
        depends on local customs processing and which country customer is living.\n        +
        Super fast shipping: arrive in 3 - 5 days. Contact me if you want super fast
        shipping method.\n\n3. Other details of the product:\n\n+ Glass lens with
        no scratches and very pure.\n\n+ High quality conductive silicone were installed.
        The Dpad, AB buttons feel great and responsive (Most of normal conductive
        silicone in the market now make the Dpad,AB buttons really stiff).\n\n+ Shell
        is modified correctly which makes the shell close properly, two parts of the
        shell fit well.\n\n***These upgrades need more power so we should use rechargeable
        AAs battery for better playtime. And the battery life depends on its brandname.\n\n4.
        Tiny dust may fly to the backside of the lens while being shipped. This is
        out of my control.\n\n5. No battery, no cartridge, no charger (if you choose
        rechargeable mod) include.\n \n\nOthers:  \n\n1. We are sorry that we won&#39;t
        be responsible for any wrong or undeliverable addresses \n\n2. Order will
        be shipped out within 2-3 business days after receiving cleared payment \n\nInternational

        out the video of overview of all the mods to see how they work and our gallery
        of products here:\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17909877412934131\/\n\nDESCRIPTION
        \n\n1. IPS LCD v2\n   + &quot;4 pixels in 1&quot; compare to AGS101 LCD, it
        means it displays 4 times sharper than AGS101 LCD\n   + Bigger than AGS101
        LCD but still have proportional image\n   + 10 brightness levels (press on
        select + L or R button to change the brightness)\n   + Wider viewing angle\n   +
        Around 10+ hours playing with 1900mah AA battery (brightness level 5, no sound
        upgrade)\n   You will get the newest version of the LCD, no issues.\n\n2.
        Extra mods and shipping (Combine the 2 variations to determine the price,
        choose the &quot;extra mods 1&quot; first) :\n\n  - Louder sound: an amp board
        is installed to amplify the sound. Most of the GBA speakers in the market
        now are very quiet. This mod will improve the sound much better.\n\n\n  -
        OverClocking: Speed up\/down the game. Hardware will be modified so that player
        can change the speed of the game to 3 levels via a switch which is installed
        nicely on the top right of the GBA (see picture). 3 speeds are 0.85x, 1x (normal
        speed) and 1.5x. This mod is for bypassing the long text (games like Pokemon)
        or slowing down the action moving on the fighting games.\n  Note: 0.85x and
        1.5x are for genuine game cartridges only. Do not work stably with flashcart
        at 0.85x and 1.5x (game may freeze). Still functioning with GBA Link Cable
        when both devices are at the same speed (if the second device has this mod
        too).\nSee video at my Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9qgHGFH_Eq\/?igshid=ots3ksxukg3j\n\n  -
        Rechargeable AAs mod: The device is modified so that player can charge the
        rechargeable AAs batteries (Nimh batteries) directly from the device via micro
        usb\/Type C charging port built-in (at the top left of the GBA), please let
        me know in &quot; Personalization box&quot; which kind of port you would like
        (Micro usb or Type C port). Can use any phone charge which has 5v out to charge
        it. (Note that if you choose type C port, it is not compatible with &quot;type
        C to type C&quot; cable, you please use &quot;type A to Type C&quot; cable).\nIt
        still works with normal AAs batteries normally.\n\nLED indicator:\nHigh power:
        green\nLow power: red\nCharged: yellow, when full charged it is off.\n\nOnly
        charge when the batteries are inserted.\n\n  - Bluetooth mod: this mod lets
        you be able to get Bluetooth Audio working on your GBA in case you&#39;d like
        to have your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker work with your favorite handheld.
        This is how it works:\n      \n     + Slide the switch located at the bottom
        of the GBA to turn on the bluetooth function whenever you want to use your
        bluetooth headphones\/speaker, the power led will blink fast in blue and it
        starts searching your bluetooth headphones\/speaker, after successfully pairing
        with your headphone, power led will blink slowly in blue (while the green\/red
        power led of the GBA still works normally)\n     + Turning on the Bluetooth
        function will disable the speaker and headphone jack of the GBA, all the sound
        of the game will be transferred to your bluetooth headphones\/speaker. There
        is a small latency when transferring the sound to the Bluetooth device but
        it is barely noticeable.\n     + You can use either GBA&#39;s volume wheel
        or your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker to adjust the volume of the sound.\n     +
        Connection is good if you keep the the distance between your GBA and your
        Bluetooth Headphones\/Speaker less than 5 meters.\n     + Make sure your bluetooth
        device disconnected before making new connection with the GBA. Sometimes you
        may need to turn on and off the bluetooth to pair succesfully.\n     + Battery
        life of the GBA when using Bluetooth function: around 7-8 hours with 3000
        mAh AAs batteries (Brightness at level 5, IPS LCD).\n     + Due to the power
        supply from just a couple of AA batteries, you will hear noticeable humming
        sound from your bluetooth device when the GBA in standby mode, the humming
        sound will be almost covered by the music of the game (don&#39;t worry there
        is not any background sound from the inner speaker and the headphone jack
        of the GBA).\n     + It is compatible with most of bluetooth devices in the
        market now, but I can not test every bluetooth device to say surely it will
        work with your bluetooth device, if you find out it can not pair with your
        bluetooth device after receiving the GBA, please try with another bluetooth
        device.\n\n\n  - Fast shipping: arrive in 10-15 days after shipment. Tracking
        information will be only available after the package arrives customer&#39;s
        country (around 7-10 days after shipment).\n        + The item is shipped
        from Asia. Default shipping is standard method. It takes 15-30 days to arrive,
        depends on local customs processing and which country customer is living.\n        +
        Super fast shipping: arrive in 3 - 5 days. Contact me if you want super fast
        shipping method.\n\n3. Other details of the product:\n\n+ Glass lens with
        no scratches and very pure.\n\n+ High quality conductive silicone were installed.
        The Dpad, AB buttons feel great and responsive (Most of normal conductive
        silicone in the market now make the Dpad,AB buttons really stiff).\n\n+ Shell
        is modified correctly which makes the shell close properly, two parts of the
        shell fit well.\n\n***These upgrades need more power so we should use rechargeable
        AAs battery for better playtime. And the battery life depends on its brandname.\n\n4.
        Tiny dust may fly to the backside of the lens while being shipped. This is
        out of my control.\n\n5. No battery, no cartridge, no charger (if you choose
        rechargeable mod) include.\n \n\nOthers:  \n\n1. We are sorry that we won&#39;t
        be responsible for any wrong or undeliverable addresses \n\n2. Order will
