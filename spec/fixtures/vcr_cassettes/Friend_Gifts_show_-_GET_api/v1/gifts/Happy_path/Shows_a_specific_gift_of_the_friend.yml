        size and estimation chart is just an estimation of size per age range. Hat
        size varies by age so the best way to get the most accurate size is to measure
        the intended wearers head with a tape measure. Please keep in mind that I
        do not give refunds so use this chart as a guideline only before purchasing.\n\n\nIf
        you need a custom size please select the finish you want then select custom
        size. Make sure to send me the correct size and length of the hat that you
        need in the note to seller box. I will contact you if anything else is needed.
        Once the hat is completed, I will notify you and then ship it. Once the hat
        is shipped, it is considered complete and cannot be altered so please make
        sure to give me all information needed before then.\n\n\nPurchasing a gift
