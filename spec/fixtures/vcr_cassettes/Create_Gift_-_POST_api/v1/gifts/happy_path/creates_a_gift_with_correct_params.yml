        the carabiner.\nA length adjuster cannot be incorporated because of the raised

        \n\nWhat&#39;s the number one thing you touch when playing guitar besides
        your strings? Your PICK!  We were tired of the boring, generic picks made
        of flimsy plastic and wanted something that felt great and made us smile each
        time we picked (haha) it up! So we came up with these fun floral designs and
        print them on high quality acrylic plastic. The print covers the entire pick
        in a thick coating, unlike most other printed picks which is digitally printed
        on basic plastic. This provides a nice texture and a true luxury feel. We
        are very proud of the quality of these picks and think you will love them!\n\nThese
        are our custom designs printed onto 0.7mm celluloid picks. The thickness allows
        for slight flex while strumming but also maintains enough stiffness for picking.
        It&#39;s the perfect all-around guitar pick!\n\n**If you have a preference
        for which picks you receive, please reference the numbers in the last photo
        and let us know. Otherwise, we will provide a random assortment. The 12-pack
        includes one of each design unless otherwise specified.\n\nThese are real
        guitar picks intended for playing guitar, but are also great for crafts or
        jewelry!","creation_tsz":1626722417,"ending_tsz":1637353217,"original_creation_tsz":1611258690,"last_modified_tsz":1626722417,"price":"4.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":12,"sku":[],"tags":["guitar

        GEBBEN White Glaze Round Box or Container w TURTLE Lid - Animal Tortoise Reptile
        Art For Guitar Picks, Paper Clips, Small Jewelry.","description":"Willem Gebben
        makes traditional wood-fired stoneware and porcelain at his studio, HILLCREST
        POTTERY, in rural Wisconsin.\n\nThis TURTLE POT is Wood-Fired Stoneware (White
        Glaze) with finger wipes on the sides and raised dots around the circumstance
        of the lid. The cute lifelike turtle on the top is approximately 2 inches
        long (including its tail) with small circular bumps on its shell. It has a
        distinct face with penetrating eyes and four detailed feet.  The circular
        box is approx. 3 3\/8 inches wide and 2 1\/2 inches high. It&#39;s a creamy
        white. The interior is slightly tan with light brown speckles. There is a
        slight imperfection on the circular edge, but this bears no impact on the
        lid fitting correctly and is barely noticeable. This small container could
        be used to hold spare change, earrings, rings, or other small jewelry, paper
        clips, guitar picks or whatever you choose. It would make a great gift - especially
        for someone who likes turtles or tortoises - or someone who collects boxes.\n\nThis
        pot has Willem Gebben&#39;s stamp (Maker&#39;s Mark for Hoillcrest Pottery)
        contained within a small circle near the base.\n  \nGebben&#39;s beautiful
        handmade pottery is not only useful, it also adds creativity to your daily
        life and adds beauty to your home or office.\n\nThe main emphasis of Gebben
        is to create a wide variety of wood-fired functional pottery. Using techniques
        that are thousands of years old, Willem mixes and dries the clay himself,
        then forms each piece by hand on a foot-powered wheel, applying home-made
        glazes before firing the new pots in wood-burning kilns. These kilns, designed
        after ancient Chinese models, are what give Willem\u2019s pieces a sturdy
        grace and quiet beauty. To achieve this look, cords of wood are burned below
        the chambers in which the pottery has been painstakingly stacked. It takes
        18 hours to achieve a temperature of 2,350 degrees Fahrenheit; then the pottery
        creations are allowed to slowly cool. Because of these processes, each pot
        is unique - no two are exactly alike.\n\nNote: None of the pottery made by
        Gebben contain lead, and they are dishwasher safe and ideal for the oven and
        microwave. \n\nSpecial Note: sometimes the camera leaves flash patterns on
        the photos & colors change with natural light vs. artificial lights.\n\nThis
        will be sent via USPS Priority Mail in the U.S. (with tracking & insurance)
        and via USPS International Mail (with insurance) elsewhere.   *See Shipping
        & Policies for more information.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION:\nWillem Gebben
        is a traditional potter making functional pots. Born in Delft, the Netherlands,
        he received his BS degree from Grand Valley State University in Michigan,
        and in 1976 apprenticed with master potter David Eeles at Shepherds Well Pottery
        in Mosterton, Dorset, England.\n\nGebben\u2019s impressive work is included
        in private collections throughout the U.S., Europe, Australia, the Middle
        East, and Japan. Also, Gebben is part of the Western Wisconsin Pottery Tour,
        an annual fall tour of Wisconsin ceramic artists&#39; studios.\n\nHis wood-fired
        stoneware and porcelain pots have been featured in numerous periodicals, books
        such as THE ART OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN POTTERY (Krause Publications) and
        WOOD-FIRED CERAMICS - CONTEMPORARY PRACTICES (University of Pennsylvania Press),
        and also television shows. Public collections of his work include Plains Art
        Museum, Fargo, ND; University of St. Thomas, St. Paul, MN; Charles A. Wustum
        Museum of Fine Arts, Racine, WI; The Detroit Institute of Art, Detroit, MI;
        and the United States Embassy, Tokyo, Japan.\n\nThe main emphasis of Gebben
        is to create a wide variety of wood-fired functional pottery. Using techniques
        that are thousands of years old, Willem mixes and dries the clay himself,
        then forms each piece by hand on a foot-powered wheel, applying home-made
        glazes before firing the new pots in wood-burning kilns. It takes 18 hours
        to achieve a temperature of 2,350 degrees Fahrenheit; then the pottery creations
        are allowed to slowly cool.\n\nGebben\u2019s sure sense of form and expert
        handling of surface, texture, and detailing make each piece a true work of
        art. His pottery consists of Once-fired, Wood-fired, and Salt-Glazed Stoneware
        as well as Porcelain.\n\nYou can view examples of his work in the &quot;Gallery&quot;
        Section under the heading &quot;Ceramics&quot; on Portal.Wisconsin, (www.portalwisconsin.org)
        an online gallery to promote the arts in Wisconsin. Also, you can watch a
        YouTube video of Willem Gebben at work (http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qgb-OsYvVS0).\n\nARTIST
        STATEMENT:\n\u201cIt is important for me to work within the traditional role
        of potter;\nmaking pots that are meant to be used.\nIt is this aspect of craft
        that separates it from the other arts,\nsuch as painting or sculpture. It
        is through the elements of touch and use\nthat the communication between the
        object and the user occurs.\n\nI am also very interested in form,\nwhich in
        large part is what the art of pottery is about;\nthe tactile qualities, the
        weight, how the pots feel in the hand.\n\nIn this age of increasing dependence
        on machine-made things\nand the worship of technology,\nI think it is essential
        that handmade objects are still made\nand used as a way for us to communicate
        with each other.\u201d","creation_tsz":1626722066,"ending_tsz":1637352866,"original_creation_tsz":1606178842,"last_modified_tsz":1626722066,"price":"38.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"sku":[],"tags":["Willem

        every single raw fabric edge. There may, with time, end up being some stray
        threads that are purely cosmetic and can be remedied with a quick trim and
        it will look great again. If desired you can lightly press the applique with
        an iron. Thank you!","creation_tsz":1626721996,"ending_tsz":1637352796,"original_creation_tsz":1602881821,"last_modified_tsz":1626721996,"price":"20.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"sku":[],"tags":["fall","Halloween

        The strap can either be attached to a strap button on the neck heel or tied
        at the headstock - the total adjustment length is from strap button hole to
        strap button hole exclusive of the headstock tie.\n\nMost straps can be shortened
        or lengthened on request at the time of ordering. The strap button hole for
        the lower bout of your instrument can be enlarged on request to accommodate
        an input jack.  Please send me a request at the time of ordering.\n\nPlease
        take a look at my other instrument straps available in my Etsy shop and thanks
