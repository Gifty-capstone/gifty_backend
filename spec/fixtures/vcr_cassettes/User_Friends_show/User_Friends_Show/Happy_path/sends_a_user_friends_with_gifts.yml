        the intended wearers head with a tape measure. Please keep in mind that I
        do not give refunds so use this chart as a guideline only before purchasing.\n\n\nIf
        you need a custom size please select the finish you want then select custom
        size. Make sure to send me the correct size and length of the hat that you
        need in the note to seller box. I will contact you if anything else is needed.
        Once the hat is completed, I will notify you and then ship it. Once the hat
        is shipped, it is considered complete and cannot be altered so please make
        sure to give me all information needed before then.\n\n\nPurchasing a gift

        Place Card, Cake Topper, Party Name Tags","description":"This listing is for
        1 laser cut name in a variety of colors and materials. \nWe take pride and
        care on our products, we want you to be happy on this very special day of
        yours. \n\nSize: Each name-tag is approx. 3-5 inch in length, depending on
        the number of characters in the name. \nWe calculate font size based on the
        longest and shortest name you have and then we determine the font size used
        for ALL your name tags.\n\n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nIf
        you want name-tags that require multiple words like &quot;Uncle Felix&quot;,
        these would be counted and cut as two words. If you want, I can glue the words
        together by design,  like &quot;Uncle Felix&quot; but regardless, they will
        count as two separate words based on the length. Similar to &quot;Maid of
        Honor&quot; or Grandma and Grandpa&quot;. \nIf you are not sure of the name
        count, please contact me BEFORE you place the order. \nPrice adjustments once
        the order is placed are somewhat cumbersome.\n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\nFONTS:\nWhile
        we do offer 4 fonts for the name tags, not all of the fonts will work properly
        for your needs. \nFont A - works best for medium, and larger names (M, L)
        \nFont B - works best for larger names (L)\nFont C - works best for small,
        medium, and large name (S,M,L)\nFont D - works best for medium to large names
        (L)\n\nPlease note the fonts are very fragile. \n=======================================\n\nFor
        each specific font, some of the loops on the font can be a bit tricky to work
        with. \nWhile we can use ANY font, the end result would be a very fragile
        name tag, so please consider this when placing the order.\nWe want you to
        be 100% happy with the look and quality of the name tags, this is why we&#39;re
        giving soo many details.\n\n\nMATERIAL: We use birch ply as the main material
        as it is soft, very light in color, and easily paintable. Wood is chemically
        treated \nColors: Please select the color you want when placing the order.
        We use water base colors, or for a larger number of names, spray paint for
        furniture.\nThe paint will be on the front of the tag ONLY, wood color on
        the back, black where laser cuts (interior).\n\nNAME: Please carefully put
        the name list in Note to Seller box. We are NOT responsible if you spelled
        the name wrong, so please be careful when adding names. \nPlease use a comma
        between the names (John,  Jackie, Vince, etc). I\u2019ll try and catch any
        errors on names when something obvious shows up.\n\nPRODUCTION TIME:\nWe&#39;ll
        start working on your name tags right after the order is placed. \nWe aim
        to ship in max. 2 days, but for bigger orders, sometimes it takes a bit longer.
        \nOne day usually is needed for paint to dry.\n\nSHIPPING: Standard shipping
        is Economy, no tracking nor insurance if the package gets lost. Shipping upgrades
        are available when placing the order, please contact me before placing order.\n\nThank
        you for stopping by, I hope you enjoy our name tags, for further customizations,

        is timeless and romantic. Add a vintage inspired touch to your wedding reception
        table with this gray lace table runner.\n\n\u273f Size: approx 7&quot; wide
        by the length you choose.  Ends are cut and not hemmed. \n- If you have 60&quot;
        table, this runner will give you about 6&quot; overhang either end. If you
        have 72&quot; or longer table, you will need at least 84&quot; or longer runner
        in order to have some overhang. Most people prefer 6&quot; to 1 foot overhang
        either end. A few want the runners to go all the way to floor.\n- Other lengths
        are also available.  Please contact us if you need a different length.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nFAQ:\n\n-
        What size of table runners do I need?\nThe size you need will depend on the
        size of your table and how long you like the overhang to be. Most people prefer
        6&quot; to 12&quot; overhang on each end of the table. The length of the runner
        will be the length of the table plus 2 times the overhang. We can custom make
        them in any size. Please contact us for a price quote.\n\n- Can I get a free
        swatch?\nWe&#39;re happy to send you one fabric swatch prior to your purchase
        to make sure you like the color and material. Additional swatches are available
        at $1 each. Please send us your mailing address.\n\n- How do I make a purchase

        12 color coordinated pages showing details, cut lists, material break down,
        and step by step instructions on how to assemble the final product.\n\nThe
        chair was designed by a skilled carpenter and is constructed to last for years.
        All of my plans are designed and built by myself from start to finish. Any
        revisions that were needed to make is a smoother assembly have been added
        to the plans.\n\nThe chair is designed to accommodate QTY (2) 25&quot; x 25&quot;
        X 5&quot; seat cushion.\nLink to cushions used in the pictures:\nhttps:\/\/www.kohls.com\/product\/prd-3553823\/sonoma-goods-for-life-indoor-outdoor-deep-seat-cushion-set.jsp?color=Khaki&prdPV=1\n\n\nMaterials

        in plan \nWood species can be substituted as long as they are 2x4 and 2x6.\nMaterials
        used in the pictures is Red Cedar. \n\nCost to build averages around $150
        - $200 depending on your location and your choice of materials used.\n\nAll
        joints used in these chairs is pocket holes and glue. Other methods maybe
        used, such as dowels, domino&#39;s, or just wood screws. That will be up to
        the carpenter to decide on that.\n\nTools required to complete this job include,
        but not limited too a miter saw, table saw, circular saw, drill, router, pocket
        hole jig and sanding equipment.\n\nI also provide free email support if you

        Women&#39;s LDS Temple Chair Pouch\n100% Cotton, (except mesh pocket option)\n(Design
        Copyright 2019)\n\nThis is my newest and most simple design yet!\nThis envelope
        helps keep sacred Endowment ceremony clothing from falling on the floor.  It
        is quiet, with no snaps or velcro, and very subtle to use.  It is &quot;temple
        white&quot;.  It fits most standard folding temple chairs including the wider
        seats and fits nicely in your pocket.\n\nNew options allow for more individual
        piece organization with 3 inside pockets instead of just 2.\nThe optional
        mesh pocket is ideal for the temple worker for easy name tag placement.  Instead
        of pinning your name to the packet, it can be quickly and easily slipped into
        the see-through pocket.\n\n*More laces to choose for the pocket! (for both
        fabric and mesh).  Choose a letter and enter it in the &quot;Add your personalization&quot;
        box below the pocket choices.  If no lace option is selected, the original
        small lace A will be used.\n\nThe prop chair in the photos is wider than temple
        seats, so the pouch will typically fit better on temple chairs. \nThe props
        used inside the temple pouch are squares of folded fabric.\n\n\nDirections:\nOpen
        and lay pouch against your chair back.  \nPull the flap over the top and edges
        of the chair to secure the pouch.  \nPull it off your chair when no longer
        needed in the ceremony.\n\n\n*Please make sure your temple approves of its
        use before using.  \n**The Houston Temple leadership approves of the use of
        this pouch.\n\n\nWashing Instructions:\nMachine wash cold, gentle\nTumble
        Dry Low\nWarm Iron\n\nAlways improving the product, I welcome your input.  Please
        let me know how you like the way it works for you.\n\nThis is an original

        Bohemian 70s Bamboo Chair","description":"Straight from 60s or maybe the 70s
        but oh so fashionable now, these chairs are a great vintage bargain, very
        in vogue, not skimping on comfort and bringing that boho modernist feel to
        your mid century home, maybe in a bedroom or up on a balcony!\n\nIn the style
        of Franco Albini, these chairs tick all the boxes, being constructed from
        sustainable natural materials that have been used for centuries all over the
        world and provide a timeless, stylish addition to any setting, inside or out.
        \n\nWe have sold a few of these chairs in lots of different styles but this
        one features beautifully intertwined round hoop shapes and a fanned spoke
        back rest,  having characterful wear and tear, but in good usable vintage
        condition for its age. There are no loose or missing strappings and visibly
        look like the original bindings. The chair has at some point been given a
        varnish so the colouring is a warm golden shade not as pale as a lot of other
        bamboo. The chair has had a thorough dust and clean and been oiled to protect
        and enhance. \n\nThis price listed is for one chair - please see our other
        listings for more bamboo - chairs and accessories. Happy to discount for multiple
        purchases with simultaneous delivery. \n\nPlease bear in mind that all our
        vintage and retro items have had a life before you purchase them (sometimes
        quite a long one!) therefore they will show signs of wear and use. We never
        sell items that we wouldn\u2019t be happy to have in our own homes and provide
        images detailing any significant damage or unusual wear. Please read the details
        and examine the images prior to purchase. If you\u2019re unsure, or would
        like some more information, please contact us, we\u2019re always happy to
        help.\n\nApproximate Measurements\n\nHeight 84cm\nSeat height 37cm\nWidth

        purchase in a timely fashion is both our priority and also one of the most
        challenging aspects of our business.\n\u00a0\nIn most circumstances, we offer
        free hand delivery, contact-free, to most mainland UK addresses, either by
        ourselves or via our dedicated, trusted,  couriers. This ensures that your
        purchases arrive in exactly the condition they were in when you purchased
        them, as accurately described on our site. You should expect delivery to be
        within 1 to 3 weeks of you placing the order. We will contact you directly
        with a firm delivery date and advise you in advance of a two hour delivery
        window. Free delivery does not apply to areas of mainland UK not covered by
        our trusted couriers - if this applies to your purchase, we will simply charge
        you what we are charged for delivery, less any Etsy fees, and notify you of
        this as soon a practicable after the sale goes through, giving you the option
        of a full refund.\n\u00a0\nWe are able to package and export items beyond
        mainland UK and have done so as far afield as Hong Kong and New Zealand. We
        regularly export to Northern Ireland and Eire and the majority of Europe.
        Please contact us directly for a tailored quotation.\n\u00a0\nWhen ordering,
        please supply us with your mobile phone number, so we may liaise directly
        with you regarding delivery. Please advise if there are any delivery restrictions
        that will apply (such as access, parking restrictions etc.).\n\u00a0\nPlease
        note that if we are unable to deliver on a pre-arranged day, you will be charged
        a flat fee of \u00a350 for re-delivery.","creation_tsz":1626721867,"ending_tsz":1637352667,"original_creation_tsz":1616092498,"last_modified_tsz":1626721867,"price":"180.00","currency_code":"GBP","quantity":1,"sku":["68801950"],"tags":["Scandinavian
