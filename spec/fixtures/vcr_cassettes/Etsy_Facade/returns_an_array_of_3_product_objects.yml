        fact-jack!&quot; lol, This is 2\/4 to my Super Nintendo Turtles in Time Collection.\n\nMy
        favorite game of all time is Turtles in time for the snes and if it weren&#39;t
        for my parents unknowingly buying my the first issue to the original comic
        series back in the 80&#39;s on a random whim, My 6 year old self probably
        wouldn&#39;t be drawing today. I always feel like every major turtles fan
        has one of these awesome stories about how the TMNT changed their lives lol.\n\nPlease
        let me know if you would like me to sign the front or back of this illustration!
        My signature is relatively small, and I usually sign on the front in an area
        that doesn&#39;t take away from the illustration.\n\nThis Digital illustration
        is printed in high quality on a thick sheet of satin paper measuring 11\/17
        inches.\nI do not crop or trim the white boarder from printing, as if for
        any reason the edges get bumped up in any type of transportation, you can
        then trim that part off for framing if desired :)\n\n\n*****************\n\nThe
        illustration is packaged in a large sturdy jazzy tube! I&#39;ll tape up the
        ends to prevent any water damage in transportation.\nAlso, due to the product
        being rolled up, you may have to put a few books on it once received in order
        to re-flatten the print once removed from the tubing. A small price to pay
        for a solid delivery!\n\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS! Hook me up with your phone
        number after ordering please.\nPlease double check your shipping address before
        finalizing your order!\nChanges may not be made after the order has been shipped
        and reshipping a returned package will be at your cost.\n\n*****************\n\nThis
        is for PERSONAL\/PRIVATE use only.\n\nPlease contact me if you have commercial
        use (license) in mind.\n\nNo returns or exchanges on items\n\nI remain the
        single owner of the character created\/designed and illustration poses and
        concepts (excluding fan art pin-ups of characters owned by respective companies,
        where art style and concept would then apply).\nI spent MANY hours creating
        this, and your help and support towards my art goes a very long way! please
        don&#39;t share this art, but instead promote others to help an indie creator
        such as myself by purchasing one for themselves.\n\nPlease contact me first
        regarding anything related to production\/mass production.\nDo not re-sell

        packaged and hold them in place during shipping and to reduce the likelihood
        of the cubes becoming cracked or damaged during the shipping process.\n- Each
        individual component has also been anchored down in place via tabs and then
        secured with glue to ensure nothing comes loose during shipping!\n- Most orders

        Mods And IPS Backlit LCD GBA Mod Nintendo GameBoy Advance White","description":"Check
        out the video of overview of all the mods to see how they work and our gallery
        of products here:\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17909877412934131\/\n\nDESCRIPTION
        \n\n1. IPS LCD v2\n   + &quot;4 pixels in 1&quot; compare to AGS101 LCD, it
        means it displays 4 times sharper than AGS101 LCD\n   + Bigger than AGS101
        LCD but still have proportional image\n   + 10 brightness levels (press on
        select + L or R button to change the brightness)\n   + Wider viewing angle\n   +
        Around 10+ hours playing with 1900mah AA battery (brightness level 5, no sound
        upgrade)\n   You will get the newest version of the LCD, no issues.\n\n2.
        Extra mods and shipping (Combine the 2 variations to determine the price,
        choose the &quot;extra mods 1&quot; first) :\n\n  - Louder sound: an amp board
        is installed to amplify the sound. Most of the GBA speakers in the market
        now are very quiet. This mod will improve the sound much better.\n\n\n  -
        OverClocking: Speed up\/down the game. Hardware will be modified so that player
        can change the speed of the game to 3 levels via a switch which is installed
        nicely on the top right of the GBA (see picture). 3 speeds are 0.85x, 1x (normal
        speed) and 1.5x. This mod is for bypassing the long text (games like Pokemon)
        or slowing down the action moving on the fighting games.\n  Note: 0.85x and
        1.5x are for genuine game cartridges only. Do not work stably with flashcart
        at 0.85x and 1.5x (game may freeze). Still functioning with GBA Link Cable
        when both devices are at the same speed (if the second device has this mod
        too).\nSee video at my Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9qgHGFH_Eq\/?igshid=ots3ksxukg3j\n\n  -
        Rechargeable AAs mod: The device is modified so that player can charge the
        rechargeable AAs batteries (Nimh batteries) directly from the device via micro
        usb\/Type C charging port built-in (at the top left of the GBA), please let
        me know in &quot; Personalization box&quot; which kind of port you would like
        (Micro usb or Type C port). Can use any phone charge which has 5v out to charge
        it. (Note that if you choose type C port, it is not compatible with &quot;type
        C to type C&quot; cable, you please use &quot;type A to Type C&quot; cable).\nIt
        still works with normal AAs batteries normally.\n\nLED indicator:\nHigh power:
        green\nLow power: red\nCharged: yellow, when full charged it is off.\n\nOnly
        charge when the batteries are inserted.\n\n  - Bluetooth mod: this mod lets
        you be able to get Bluetooth Audio working on your GBA in case you&#39;d like
        to have your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker work with your favorite handheld.
        This is how it works:\n      \n     + Slide the switch located at the bottom
        of the GBA to turn on the bluetooth function whenever you want to use your
        bluetooth headphones\/speaker, the power led will blink fast in blue and it
        starts searching your bluetooth headphones\/speaker, after successfully pairing
        with your headphone, power led will blink slowly in blue (while the green\/red
        power led of the GBA still works normally)\n     + Turning on the Bluetooth
        function will disable the speaker and headphone jack of the GBA, all the sound
        of the game will be transferred to your bluetooth headphones\/speaker. There
        is a small latency when transferring the sound to the Bluetooth device but
        it is barely noticeable.\n     + You can use either GBA&#39;s volume wheel
        or your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker to adjust the volume of the sound.\n     +
        Connection is good if you keep the the distance between your GBA and your
        Bluetooth Headphones\/Speaker less than 5 meters.\n     + Make sure your bluetooth
        device disconnected before making new connection with the GBA. Sometimes you
        may need to turn on and off the bluetooth to pair succesfully.\n     + Battery
        life of the GBA when using Bluetooth function: around 7-8 hours with 3000
        mAh AAs batteries (Brightness at level 5, IPS LCD).\n     + Due to the power
        supply from just a couple of AA batteries, you will hear noticeable humming
        sound from your bluetooth device when the GBA in standby mode, the humming
        sound will be almost covered by the music of the game (don&#39;t worry there
        is not any background sound from the inner speaker and the headphone jack
        of the GBA).\n     + It is compatible with most of bluetooth devices in the
        market now, but I can not test every bluetooth device to say surely it will
        work with your bluetooth device, if you find out it can not pair with your
        bluetooth device after receiving the GBA, please try with another bluetooth
        device.\n\n\n  - Fast shipping: arrive in 10-15 days after shipment. Tracking
        information will be only available after the package arrives customer&#39;s
        country (around 7-10 days after shipment).\n        + The item is shipped
        from Asia. Default shipping is standard method. It takes 15-30 days to arrive,
        depends on local customs processing and which country customer is living.\n        +
        Super fast shipping: arrive in 3 - 5 days. Contact me if you want super fast
        shipping method.\n\n3. Other details of the product:\n\n+ Glass lens with
        no scratches and very pure.\n\n+ High quality conductive silicone were installed.
        The Dpad, AB buttons feel great and responsive (Most of normal conductive
        silicone in the market now make the Dpad,AB buttons really stiff).\n\n+ Shell
        is modified correctly which makes the shell close properly, two parts of the
        shell fit well.\n\n***These upgrades need more power so we should use rechargeable
        AAs battery for better playtime. And the battery life depends on its brandname.\n\n4.
        Tiny dust may fly to the backside of the lens while being shipped. This is
        out of my control.\n\n5. No battery, no cartridge, no charger (if you choose
        rechargeable mod) include.\n \n\nOthers:  \n\n1. We are sorry that we won&#39;t
        be responsible for any wrong or undeliverable addresses \n\n2. Order will
        be shipped out within 2-3 business days after receiving cleared payment \n\nInternational

        Mods And IPS Backlit LCD GBA Mod Nintendo GameBoy Advance Yellow","description":"Check
        out the video of overview of all the mods to see how they work and our gallery
        of products here:\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stories\/highlights\/17909877412934131\/\n\nDESCRIPTION
        \n\n1. IPS LCD v2\n   + &quot;4 pixels in 1&quot; compare to AGS101 LCD, it
        means it displays 4 times sharper than AGS101 LCD\n   + Bigger than AGS101
        LCD but still have proportional image\n   + 10 brightness levels (press on
        select + L or R button to change the brightness)\n   + Wider viewing angle\n   +
        Around 10+ hours playing with 1900mah AA battery (brightness level 5, no sound
        upgrade)\n   You will get the newest version of the LCD, no issues.\n\n2.
        Extra mods and shipping (Combine the 2 variations to determine the price,
        choose the &quot;extra mods 1&quot; first) :\n\n  - Louder sound: an amp board
        is installed to amplify the sound. Most of the GBA speakers in the market
        now are very quiet. This mod will improve the sound much better.\n\n\n  -
        OverClocking: Speed up\/down the game. Hardware will be modified so that player
        can change the speed of the game to 3 levels via a switch which is installed
        nicely on the top right of the GBA (see picture). 3 speeds are 0.85x, 1x (normal
        speed) and 1.5x. This mod is for bypassing the long text (games like Pokemon)
        or slowing down the action moving on the fighting games.\n  Note: 0.85x and
        1.5x are for genuine game cartridges only. Do not work stably with flashcart
        at 0.85x and 1.5x (game may freeze). Still functioning with GBA Link Cable
        when both devices are at the same speed (if the second device has this mod
        too).\nSee video at my Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9qgHGFH_Eq\/?igshid=ots3ksxukg3j\n\n  -
        Rechargeable AAs mod: The device is modified so that player can charge the
        rechargeable AAs batteries (Nimh batteries) directly from the device via micro
        usb\/Type C charging port built-in (at the top left of the GBA), please let
        me know in &quot; Personalization box&quot; which kind of port you would like
        (Micro usb or Type C port). Can use any phone charge which has 5v out to charge
        it. (Note that if you choose type C port, it is not compatible with &quot;type
        C to type C&quot; cable, you please use &quot;type A to Type C&quot; cable).\nIt
        still works with normal AAs batteries normally.\n\nLED indicator:\nHigh power:
        green\nLow power: red\nCharged: yellow, when full charged it is off.\n\nOnly
        charge when the batteries are inserted.\n\n  - Bluetooth mod: this mod lets
        you be able to get Bluetooth Audio working on your GBA in case you&#39;d like
        to have your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker work with your favorite handheld.
        This is how it works:\n      \n     + Slide the switch located at the bottom
        of the GBA to turn on the bluetooth function whenever you want to use your
        bluetooth headphones\/speaker, the power led will blink fast in blue and it
        starts searching your bluetooth headphones\/speaker, after successfully pairing
        with your headphone, power led will blink slowly in blue (while the green\/red
        power led of the GBA still works normally)\n     + Turning on the Bluetooth
        function will disable the speaker and headphone jack of the GBA, all the sound
        of the game will be transferred to your bluetooth headphones\/speaker. There
        is a small latency when transferring the sound to the Bluetooth device but
        it is barely noticeable.\n     + You can use either GBA&#39;s volume wheel
        or your Bluetooth headphones\/speaker to adjust the volume of the sound.\n     +
        Connection is good if you keep the the distance between your GBA and your
        Bluetooth Headphones\/Speaker less than 5 meters.\n     + Make sure your bluetooth
        device disconnected before making new connection with the GBA. Sometimes you
        may need to turn on and off the bluetooth to pair succesfully.\n     + Battery
        life of the GBA when using Bluetooth function: around 7-8 hours with 3000
        mAh AAs batteries (Brightness at level 5, IPS LCD).\n     + Due to the power
        supply from just a couple of AA batteries, you will hear noticeable humming
        sound from your bluetooth device when the GBA in standby mode, the humming
        sound will be almost covered by the music of the game (don&#39;t worry there
        is not any background sound from the inner speaker and the headphone jack
        of the GBA).\n     + It is compatible with most of bluetooth devices in the
        market now, but I can not test every bluetooth device to say surely it will
        work with your bluetooth device, if you find out it can not pair with your
        bluetooth device after receiving the GBA, please try with another bluetooth
        device.\n\n\n  - Fast shipping: arrive in 10-15 days after shipment. Tracking
        information will be only available after the package arrives customer&#39;s
        country (around 7-10 days after shipment).\n        + The item is shipped
        from Asia. Default shipping is standard method. It takes 15-30 days to arrive,
        depends on local customs processing and which country customer is living.\n        +
        Super fast shipping: arrive in 3 - 5 days. Contact me if you want super fast
        shipping method.\n\n3. Other details of the product:\n\n+ Glass lens with
        no scratches and very pure.\n\n+ High quality conductive silicone were installed.
        The Dpad, AB buttons feel great and responsive (Most of normal conductive
        silicone in the market now make the Dpad,AB buttons really stiff).\n\n+ Shell
        is modified correctly which makes the shell close properly, two parts of the
        shell fit well.\n\n***These upgrades need more power so we should use rechargeable
        AAs battery for better playtime. And the battery life depends on its brandname.\n\n4.
        Tiny dust may fly to the backside of the lens while being shipped. This is
        out of my control.\n\n5. No battery, no cartridge, no charger (if you choose
        rechargeable mod) include.\n \n\nOthers:  \n\n1. We are sorry that we won&#39;t
        be responsible for any wrong or undeliverable addresses \n\n2. Order will

        favorite game of all time is Turtles in time for the snes and if it weren&#39;t
        for my parents unknowingly buying my the first issue to the original comic
        series back in the 80&#39;s on a random whim, My 6 year old self probably
        wouldn&#39;t be drawing today. I always feel like every major turtles fan
        has one of these awesome stories about how the TMNT changed their lives lol.\n\nPlease
        let me know if you would like me to sign the front or back of this illustration!
        My signature is relatively small, and I usually sign on the front in an area
        that doesn&#39;t take away from the illustration.\n\nThis Digital illustration
        is printed in high quality on a thick sheet of satin paper measuring 11\/17
        inches.\nI do not crop or trim the white boarder from printing, as if for
        any reason the edges get bumped up in any type of transportation, you can
        then trim that part off for framing if desired :)\n\n\n*****************\n\nThe
        illustration is packaged in a large sturdy jazzy tube! I&#39;ll tape up the
        ends to prevent any water damage in transportation.\nAlso, due to the product
        being rolled up, you may have to put a few books on it once received in order
        to re-flatten the print once removed from the tubing. A small price to pay
        for a solid delivery!\n\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS! Hook me up with your phone
        number after ordering please.\nPlease double check your shipping address before
        finalizing your order!\nChanges may not be made after the order has been shipped

        single owner of the character created\/designed and illustration poses and
        concepts (excluding fan art pin-ups of characters owned by respective companies,
        where art style and concept would then apply).\nI spent MANY hours creating
        this, and your help and support towards my art goes a very long way! please
        don&#39;t share this art, but instead promote others to help an indie creator
